# About Myself
## Who Are You Anyway?

I'll just be cheeky and start with a classic bit of code we all first probably learned.

`print("Hello world!")`

Hello world!

You can just call me Kelsie! At the time of writing I am a graduating senior at UCSD majoring in Interdisciplinary Computing in the Arts and minoring in Computer Science and Engineering.

## Why Are You in Programming?

## Have You Done Anything Fun Or Cool?

I'm currently working on a game demo for my senior project class. The game demo will be called *Killswitch* and be a rhythm-fighting game where you control a character throughout a boss fight and fight in sync to the beat of the backing soundtrack. At this time, the game itself is still in its early stages of actual development, but you can check out some info about its concept [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14k8jhXwxxiHjgZUgF6Y7mPiSnR9g2SDsqMfttyQsd-s/edit?usp=sharing), [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cUBGJgeRHwT7EjNuaZUIpleSGSjECWKnAgB0DXDKnxU/edit?usp=sharing) and [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sHi5L9jnNL1yr6pu1nzAEI0zlmMl8yK5Y3B_1g-F9BY/edit?usp=sharing).

In short, progress thus far can be summed up like this:
- [x] Think up the concept (I want to make a rhythm game demo)
- [x] Look into ways this concept can be programmed (Rather what kinda references can we start with)
- [x] Flesh out the concept (Figured out what I want it to look like, sound like, play like!)
- [ ] Now start building the game!! (By bits and pieces of course)

This demo is meant to be a love letter to my love for electronic music and provide a more immersive experience to listening to this sort of music - 'gamifying' music, if you will. It's currently a long ways to go and may be a bit ambititious for this quarter - there's always some guarentee some things will have to be modified for the sake of delivering for my final senior project. Regardless, I'm very excited to work on it and see where it goes. I've built a couple games in Unity prior, so this will be my greatest in scale thus far.

If you're curious about other stuff I've done in other classes, I've done a couple VR environments in Unreal Engine, including one called *CMY* which was a ball pit called filled with colorful metallic spike balls you can play in and climb around as a weird crystalline jungle gym using the Oculus headset.

I've also done a few p5.js projects in Javascript, one of my favorite examples - an audiovisual animation to a metal track - of which you can view [here](https://editor.p5js.org/kalloyd/sketches/o2Ipy5dX0).

I'm really hoping to take a class in Arduino either this coming quarter or my last part-time quarter. Should I update this about page further, I'll be happy to talk about any projects I make once I take it!
